About me
======

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/), School of Public Health, University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Prof. Bingkai Wang](https://bingkaiwang.com/) and [Prof. Donglin Zeng](http://bios.unc.edu/~dzeng/). My research focuses on causal inference, clinical trial, and provider profiling. I received my bachelor's degree in [School of Statistics, Renmin University of China](https://stat.ruc.edu.cn/). 

Theory and practice inevitably have a gap. My research interest is to narrow this distance by developing and applying methodological insights that are both theoretically sound and practically meaningful.

In addition to research, I am interested in playing badminton. I'm also enjoying playing piano and watching Opera. My favorite aria excerpt is “Di Provenza il mar, il suol” from La Traviata.
